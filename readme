# Running the Code
1. Run 'make pessman_client'
2. Run 'make pessman_server'
2. Make sure to have two instances on two different servers open
3. Run './pessman_client' on one instance
4. Run './pessman_server' on another instance


# Notes
- Did not implement GBN unfurtunetly
- Did not implement random errors (only user inputted)
- Did not implement dynamic timeout based on ping 
- The bigger the packet size, the weirder things tend to get...
    - I'm thinking this is because of the threading and how variable times are changing.
      Used mutex to try and help with this, which solved a lot of my issues, but maybe
      something is slipping in still.
